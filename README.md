# Infinity Bot 2
This is the 2nd version of the Infinity Bot that I made after using Python 3 and Discord.py rewrite API. This bot is made using Discord.js and Node.js and is made to learn more about Javascript and API control.

This branch is the template branch which anyone can use as a template to make a Discord.js bot.
