# Infinity Bot 2
This is the 2nd version of the Infinity Bot that I made after using Python 3 and Discord.py rewrite API. This bot is made using Discord.js and Node.js and is made to learn more about Javascript and API control. This bot is a moderation bot which can be used to moderate your guilds.

## How to use this bot
Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/Harsh-2909/Infinity-Bot-2.git` or download the zip package if git is not installed in your computer.

After that, you need to have node.js installed. Install node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

After installing node.js, goto the directory where the bot is cloned.

Open config.json and change the token, owner, and botID variables to the respective IDs.

After that, just open the terminal and use `node .` to run the bot.
